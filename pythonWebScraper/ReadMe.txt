This webscraper creates a small database from PolitiFact articles. 
This database will have 3 fields: the statement being analysed, the politifact rating and the link to the politifact article. 
This is done using Beautiful Soup 4, Requests, Pandas and Regex.
This is intended to be done just once, for the purposes of the initial prototype
